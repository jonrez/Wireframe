  <p> Owing to the intensely physical nature of grappling. A typical session includes</p>
  <p>cardiovascular training, stretching, breathing work and includes cardiovascular training,</p>
  <p>stretching, breathing work and a resistance workout. These sessions build your strength and</p>

  <h1>Boxing</h1>
  <p>Boxing has many of the same benefits as Jiu-Jitsu, but where Jiu-jitsu Incourages humility,</p>
  <p> boxing builds pride. The grace and swagger of a boxer is unmatched. The improved balance and</p>
  <p> rythm will even change the way you walk. This is only intensified by the understanding that</p>
  <p> no untrained opponent can do you harm. This Martial art pairs phenomenally well with Jiu-Jitsu, <p>
  <p> as they cover each others deficiencies in technicall abilities as well as in mentallity.</p>

 <h1>Hobby Predictor</h1>
 <p>With these three hobbies my hardest decision is which activity will I devote my time to.<p>
 <p>The answere depends on a multitude of variables. The biggest of which is the weather. </p>
 <p>This widget gives me suggestions for how I should plan my week, depending temperature and rain</p>
 <p> predictions. I don't want to play tennis if it is raining or cold, and I don't want to go to</p>
 <p> Jiu-Jitsu while its warm, because my gym has no air conditioner, and there is a lot of contact</p>
