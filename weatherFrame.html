  <h1> Jiu-Jitsu</h1>
   Owing to the intensely physical nature of grappling. A typical session includes
   cardiovascular training,
  stretching, breathing work and a resistance workout. These sessions build your strength and
  endurance, and increase flexibility. Timing and rhythm are vital to the physics behind jiu jitsu
  technique. Executing a lock or throw at the right moment feels effortless; forcing one at the
  wrong time is next to impossible. Practicing in this context builds patience and self-discipline,
  and helps reduce stress through extreme focus.</p>

  <h1>Boxing</h1>
  Boxing has many of the same benefits as Jiu-Jitsu, but where Jiu-jitsu Incourages humility,
   boxing builds pride. The grace and swagger of a boxer is unmatched. The improved balance and
   rythm will even change the way you walk. This is only intensified by the understanding that
   no untrained opponent can do you harm. This Martial art pairs phenomenally well with Jiu-Jitsu,
   as they cover each others deficiencies in mentallity as well as technicall ability.

   immense value of working hard. Discipline also comes into the foreplay, as you will need to
   constantly practice and control the pace during a match. Learning from your mistakes in tennis
   is imperative, and you can manage mistakes by learning to cope  your own deficiencies.

 <h1>Hobby Predictor</h1>
 With these three hobbies, my hardest decision of the day is which activity will I devote my time to.
 The answere depends on a multitude of variables. The biggest of which is the weather.
 This widget gives me suggestions for how I should plan my week, depending temperature and rain
  predictions. I don't want to play tennis if it is raining or cold, and I don't want to go to
  Jiu-Jitsu while its warm. The Hobby Predictor makes planning my week just that much easier.
