    <span>In Extreme Ownership, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin share hard-hitting,
       Navy SEAL combat stories that translate into lessons for business and life.
        With riveting first-hand accounts of making high-pressure decisions as
         Navy SEAL battlefield leaders, this book is equally gripping for
         leaders who seek to dominate other arenas. Jocko and Leif served
         together in SEAL Task Unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated Special
         Operations unit from the war in Iraq. Their efforts contributed to the
         historic triumph for U.S. forces in Ramadi. Through those difficult
         months of sustained combat, Jocko, Leif and their SEAL brothers learned
         that leadership–at every level–is the most important thing on the battlefield.
         They started Echelon Front to teach these same leadership principles to
         companies across industries throughout the business world that want to
          build their own high-performance, winning teams.</span>

    <span>Hastings set new standards, valuing people over process, emphasizing
      innovation over efficiency, and giving employees context, not controls.
      At Netflix, there are no vacation or expense policies. At Netflix, adequate
      performance gets a generous severance, and hard work is irrel­evant. At
       Netflix, you don’t try to please your boss, you give candid feedback
        instead. At Netflix, employees don’t need approval, and the company
         pays top of market. When Hastings and his team first devised these
         unorthodox principles, the implications were unknown and untested.
         But in just a short period, their methods led to unparalleled speed
         and boldness, as Netflix quickly became one of the most loved brands
          in the world.</span>

    <span>Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from
       psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, The Willpower Instinct
       explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. For
       example, readers will learn: Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue.
       It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise,
       nutrition, and sleep. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control
       can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's
       systems of self-control, but the brain can be trained for greater willpower
       Guilt and shame over your setbacks lead to giving in again, but self-forgiveness
       and self-compassion boost self-control. Giving up control is sometimes the
       only way to gain self-control. Willpower failures are contagious—you can
       catch the desire to overspend or overeat from your friends­­—but you can also
       catch self-control from the right role models. In the groundbreaking tradition
       of Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive
       advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from
       losing weight to more patient parenting, less procrastination, better health,
        and greater productivity at work.</span>

    <span>Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder,
       Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the
        everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively
        low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and
        secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented
        access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving
        readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared
        to tech's other elite innovators -- Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg -- Bezos is a private
        man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into
        risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail
        in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing.

    <span>First published in 1937, Carnegie's advice has remained relevant for
      generations because he addresses timeless questions about the fine art of
      getting along with people: How can you make people like you instantly? How can you persuade
       people to agree with you? How can you speak frankly to people without giving offense?
        The ability to read others and successfully navigate any social situation is
         critically important to those who want to get a job, keep a job, or simply
         expand their social network. The core principles of this book, originally
         written as a practical, working handbook on human relations, are proven effective.
         Carnegie explains the fundamentals of handling people with a positive approach;
         how to make people like you and want to help you; how to win people to your way
         of thinking without conflict; and how to be the kind of leader who inspires quality work,
         increased productivity, and high morale.</span>

   <span>here’s an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is eat
    a live frog, you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you’re done with the
    worst thing you’ll have to do all day. For Tracy, eating a frog is a metaphor
    for tackling your most challenging task - but also the one that can have the
    greatest positive impact on your life. Eat That Frog! shows you how to organize
    each day so you can zero in on these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently
    and effectively. The core of what is vital to effective time management is: decision,
    discipline, and determination. And in this fully revised and updated edition,
    Tracy adds two new chapters. The first explains how you can use technology to
    remind yourself of what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important.
    The second offers advice for maintaining focus in our era of constant distractions, electronic and otherwise.
    This life-changing book will ensure that you get more of your important tasks done today.</span>

  <span>Brian Tracy, one of the top professional speakers and sales trainers in the world today,
    found that his most important breakthrough in selling was the discovery that it is the
    "Psychology of Selling" that is more important than the techniques and methods of selling.
    Tracy's classic audio program, The Psychology of Selling, is the best-selling sales training
    program in history and is now available in expanded and updated audiobook format for the first time.
     Salespeople will learn: "The inner game of selling" how to eliminate the fear of
     rejectionhow to build unshakeable self-confidence. Sales people, says Tracy, must
      learn to control their thoughts, feelings, and actions to make themselves more effective.</span>
